Purpose: to understand the structure of the driving system and steering system of an RC car  

### Driving system

Seeing that the RC car's driving system was greased, I realized that applying grease to the driving system of my own build would be beneficial as well.

The driving system has four gears. I initially thought two would be enough, so I'm not sure why multiple gears are used. However, it's clear they weren't for transmission, since the RC car doesn't have a shifting mechanism.

### Steering system
